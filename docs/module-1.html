                <h2>Introduction: Why Structure Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Most people react to situations. They see a problem and immediately start generating solutions.
                    They feel the pressure of a deadline and start working faster. They notice a competitor's move
                    and scramble to respond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is natural. It's also almost always wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best strategic thinkers do something different. Before they act, before they even consider
                    options, they pause to see the <em>structure</em> of the situation. They ask: What forces are
                    at play here? What constraints exist? Where are the leverage points?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This module teaches you to see structure. It's the foundation of everything else in strategic thinking.

                <h2>Part 1: The Diagnosis Framework</h2>
                <p>
                    Richard Rumelt, in his book <em>Good Strategy Bad Strategy</em>, identifies the core of strategy
                    as having three parts: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent actions. Most people skip
                    straight to actions. The best strategists spend most of their time on diagnosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A diagnosis is not a description of the problem. It's an <em>interpretation</em> of the situation
                    that identifies the critical factors. It answers the question: "What's really going on here?"
                </p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> A good diagnosis simplifies complexity by identifying the one or
                    two factors that matter most. It's an act of judgment, not just analysis.
                </div>

                <h3>The Three Questions of Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>When facing any strategic situation, ask:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>What is the challenge?</strong> Not the symptom, but the underlying obstacle that makes this situation difficult.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why does this challenge exist?</strong> What structural factors created and sustain it?</li>
                    <li><strong>What would have to change?</strong> If you could change one thing about the structure, what would unlock progress?</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    These questions seem simple. They're not. Most people answer the first question with a symptom
                    ("sales are down") rather than a challenge ("we're competing on price in a commodity market
                    with higher-cost operations than our competitors").
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="reading-section">
                <h2>Part 2: Structural Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    Structure is the arrangement of parts that determines how a system behaves. In business, structure
                    includes things like: market dynamics, competitive positions, organizational capabilities,
                    regulatory constraints, and technological possibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key insight of structural thinking is that <em>behavior follows structure</em>. If you want
                    to change outcomes, you usually need to change structure, not just work harder within the
                    existing structure.
                </p>

                <h3>Symptoms vs. Root Causes</h3>
                <p>
                    A symptom is something you can observe directly. A root cause is the structural factor that
                    produces the symptom. The relationship is often non-obvious.
                </p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong>
                    <p><em>Symptom:</em> High employee turnover</p>
                    <p><em>Obvious interpretation:</em> We need better retention programs</p>
                    <p><em>Structural analysis:</em> Our compensation is tied to individual performance in a role that requires collaboration. The structure punishes the behaviors we need.</p>
                    <p><em>Root cause:</em> Misaligned incentive structure</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Notice that the structural analysis completely changes what you would do. Retention programs
                    treat the symptom. Restructuring incentives addresses the cause.
                </p>

                <h3>The Five Structural Forces</h3>
                <p>When analyzing any situation, look for these five types of structural forces:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> What behaviors does the current structure reward and punish?</li>
                    <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> What limits exist on possible actions? (Resources, regulations, physics, time)</li>
                    <li><strong>Feedback loops:</strong> What reinforcing or balancing dynamics are at play?</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> What must happen before other things can happen?</li>
                    <li><strong>Information flows:</strong> Who knows what, and when do they know it?</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section class="reading-section">
                <h2>Part 3: Leverage Points</h2>
                <p>
                    Donella Meadows, the systems thinker, defined leverage points as "places within a complex system
                    where a small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not all interventions are equal. Some actions produce disproportionate results because they
                    change the structure of the system, not just its current state.
                </p>

                <h3>The Leverage Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>From weakest to strongest, here are types of interventions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Parameters:</strong> Changing numbers (budgets, targets, prices). Easy but rarely transformative.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buffers:</strong> Changing the size of stabilizing stocks. Moderately effective.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Changing the physical or informational flows. Powerful but difficult.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rules:</strong> Changing the incentives and constraints. Very powerful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Changing what the system is trying to achieve. Transformative.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paradigms:</strong> Changing the mindset out of which the system arises. Revolutionary.</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Most people focus on parameters (the weakest leverage) because
                    they're easiest to change. Strategic thinkers focus on rules, goals, and paradigms because
                    that's where lasting change happens.

                <h2>Part 4: The Clarity Test</h2>
                <p>
                    How do you know when your structural analysis is good enough? Apply the Clarity Test:
                </p>

                <h3>The Four Criteria</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> Could someone else identify the same structural factors from your description? Vague analyses like "we need better communication" fail this test.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Can you explain <em>how</em> the structure produces the observed outcomes? If you can't trace the causal chain, you don't understand the structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> Does your analysis predict what would happen if the structure changed? Good structural understanding enables prediction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-obviousness:</strong> Would someone without your analysis reach different conclusions? If your diagnosis is obvious, you probably haven't gone deep enough.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Most analyses fail at least one of these criteria. That's fine—it tells you where to dig deeper.
                    Keep refining until your analysis passes all four.

                <h2>Putting It Together</h2>
                <p>
                    Structural clarity is not a one-time analysis. It's a way of seeing. With practice, you'll
                    start to automatically notice structural factors in every situation you encounter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is not to have a perfect analysis before acting. It's to have a <em>clear enough</em>
                    understanding of the structure that you can identify high-leverage interventions and predict
                    their likely effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This takes practice. The assignment below is designed to help you develop this skill.
