                Most people react to situations. Strategists see structure first—the forces, constraints,
                and leverage points that determine what's actually possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                This module teaches you to diagnose strategic situations with clarity. You'll learn
                frameworks used by the best strategic thinkers, then apply them through deliberate writing practice.

            <h2>What This Requires</h2>
            <p>
                This is not passive learning. There's no video to watch, no community to browse,
                no certificate to collect.
            </p>
            <p>
                You read. You think. You write. Your writing is judged.
            </p>
            <p>
                If that sounds demanding, it is. Strategic clarity doesn't come from consumption—it
                comes from practice.
