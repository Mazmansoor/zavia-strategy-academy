            <h2>What This Is</h2>
            <p>
                A writing-based module on strategic thinking. You will read dense material on strategy,
                then write an original analysis demonstrating your understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no video. No community. No certificate. No credentials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your submission will be reviewed by a human. You will receive one of two responses:
                <strong>Pass</strong> or <strong>Not Yet</strong>.

            <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
            <p>
                This requires serious engagement. The reading is dense. The writing demands
                original thinking—not summary, not regurgitation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want passive content consumption, this is not for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to develop strategic judgment through deliberate practice, continue.
